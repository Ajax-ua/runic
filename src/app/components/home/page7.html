<h1 class="md-display-1 main-title">Runic Blessing #5: Manifest Your Life’s True Destiny</h1>
<div class="text">
    <p>Your Soul’s True Destiny is revealed by the interrelationships between your energy field, the energy field of those around you and the opportunities placed in your path.</p>

    <p>Soul evolution is what we are really talking about, and every single person on this planet has an intention to evolve in some way, shape or form, during their lifetime. Sounds good, right? Well it can be … as long as you are able to access your Soul’s true guidance. If not, you can find yourself repeatedly “blindsided” by unwanted obstacles.</p>

    <p>With the Great Cosmic Shift now in full gear, manifestation is happening quicker than ever before. There are many people who are now rapidly bringing forth their dreams and living more joyful lives. Sadly, many more are descending into deeper states of darkness, due to the negative vibration they continually hold at a subconscious level. This is all because the Law of Attraction has gained such momentum since the Cosmic Shift accelerated. And it’s this momentum that’s making it more and more difficult for people to move from negative states to positive ones.</p>

    <p>That’s why, when you are under the stress of uncertainty, it is extremely difficult to feel good and shift your energies. (In fact, some would say it’s impossible.) Yet those “in the know” understand that it is ALWAYS possible to change … as long as you have the right tools.</p>

    <p>With the right tools Asdf, you too can ensure your life’s true destiny. And Rune Stone Casting is most certainly one of these tools!</p>

    <p>See, it’s not simply what you SAY (as in: affirmations) which creates your reality … it’s the energy you are carrying on a day-to-day basis. Carry negative energies (even subconsciously!) and get negative results. Carry positive energies and get positive results!</p>

    <p>That’s why you’ll want to have a very close look at this …</p>
